# secure-distributed-cloud-lab
SECURE DISTRIBUTED CLOUD ARCHITECTURES LAB PROJECT: Cloud and distributed systems underpin modern digital infrastructure across government, industry, and research domains. However, security incidents in these environments frequently arise not from zero-day exploits, but from architectural weaknesses such as misconfigurations, over-permissive access controls, and poorly defined trust boundaries.

This lab marks the first phase of a structured research programme investigating secure-by-design distributed cloud architectures. The objective is to establish a rigorous foundation for analysing how architectural decisions, identity and access management (IAM), and threat modelling can reduce attack surfaces and improve system resilience.

This work is positioned to support PhD-level research in distributed systems security, trustworthy systems, and secure software engineering, while remaining grounded in practical, real-world cloud security operations.
